-Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?

 come together before starting to code to ensure everyone is on the same page with what has been done and what needs to be done

## Conflict Resolution

-What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
 Talk to the person and ask for them to share the work load to the other person that isn’t contributing
-What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?

Let them know that it is not okay and everyone needs to contribute to the project

-How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
By pair programming every member can gain knowledge in where they lack and offer knowledge in where they are strong.
